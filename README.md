# Real Estate Data Analysis
This project involved analyzing the data of a real estate organization to extract insights like the localities with the highest sales prices, house types with the highest sales prices, highest selling property type, the trend of sales price by year, the average, median, minimum and maximum sales price.

# Insights
Greenwich was the localty with the highest property sales price while Waterbury was the lowest, with detached houses being the highest selling house type. The organization recorded higher sales from the single family property type than any other one. The data showed that the houses sold for higher than the estimated prices across all the years which is a good indication for the organization.

I used DAX formulas to extract insights like the average sales price, number of rooms, number of bathrooms and carpet area for each residence type.
